## What is the CoinEx Referral Code & How Does It Work?

A referral code on CoinEx is a unique code (or invite link) that you apply during registration or shortly after, which triggers certain benefits for new users (referred) and sometimes for the referrer as well. 

Here’s how it generally works:

- You register for a new account on CoinEx and enter the referral code “save10”.
- That code attaches certain perks (for example: trading-fee discount, signup bonus).
- Once you begin trading, you benefit from the fee discount and possibly bonus rewards.
- Optionally your referrer (if someone invited you) may earn part of your trading fees as commission.

In essence: **you get savings + bonus**; the person who referred you may get rewards too.

## What Are the Key Benefits of Using “save10”?

### 20% Off Trading Fees
One of the headline benefits is a **20% discount on trading fees** when you trade on CoinEx using the referral code “save10”. A lower fee means less cost per trade and higher potential profit retention.

For example, if the standard taker fee is 0.20%, a 20% discount would reduce it to 0.16% (0.20% × 80%).

### Bonus Up to $2,000
Another enticing benefit is the promise of a bonus **up to $2,000**, when you sign up with this referral code and meet required conditions (deposit + trading). This offer is significantly higher than many other codes (which often advertise $100 or $200) so it stands out.

### Additional Perks and Features
- The referral programme also allows you to share your own referral link once you are a user, earning a percentage of your referees’ fees.
- The fee discount is stackable with other internal discounts (like using native token for fee deduction) which can yield further savings.
- The platform supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and markets (spot, margin, futures).

## Understanding Fees, Discounts & Your Savings Potential

### Standard Trading Fee Structure at CoinEx
- Spot trading fee for VIP 0 is about 0.20% taker and 0.16% maker (without extra deductions).
- Futures trading fee for VIP 0 is about 0.03% maker and 0.05% taker.

### How the 20% Discount Works
- Example: If standard fee is 0.20%, applying 20% off means: 0.20% × (1-0.20) = **0.16%**.
- Over many trades, that difference adds up. If you trade $10,000 and your fee without discount would be $20, with discount it’s $16 → you save $4 on that trade alone.
- If you layer other savings (via token fee deduction or VIP status) you could reduce it further.

### Table – Example Savings Over Time

| Monthly Trading Volume | Standard Fee Rate | Fee After 20% Discount | Monthly Savings |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| $10,000 | 0.20% → $20 | 0.16% → $16 | $4 |
| $50,000 | 0.20% → $100 | 0.16% → $80 | $20 |
| $100,000 | 0.20% → $200 | 0.16% → $160 | $40 |

As you can see: the higher your trading volume, the more impactful the discount becomes.
